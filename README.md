# Capital Asset Pricing Model
- CAPM is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of securities
- CAPM indicates that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium

        $r_i = r_f + B_i(r_m - r_f)$ -> Calculate Return
  
- Variables
  - $r_i$ = Expected return on a Security
  - $r_f$ = Risk free rate of return
  - $B_i$ = Beta value between the stock and market
  - $r_m$ = Expected return of the Market

# Risk Free Asset Return
- A risk-free asset could be a US Government 10-year treasury bill
- Investors who are extremely risk averse would prefer to buy the risk free asset to protect their money and earn a low return
- If investors are interested in gaining more return, they have to bear more risk compared to the risk-free asset

# Market Portfolio Return
- Market Portfolio includes all securities in the market. Example, S&P500
- Market portfolio return is the average return of the overall return of Index
